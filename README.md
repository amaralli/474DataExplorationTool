Visual layout:

	I chose a bar chart to represent this data for several reasons. First, because this was was in no form continuous data, I wanted to make sure to avoid the impression that it was at all costs. This means that line charts were immediately out. Furthermore, since plot charts can often give the impression of direction, it would not work in a dataset that has only one point per type of data. The viewer may implicitly detect direction, which doesn't make sense between disparate groups of data. So, the obvious choice from here was a bar chart. Secondly, since there are few points of data to show in this form, switching between variables clearly illustrates the difference, as opposed to many dots moving across screen or appearing/dissappearing on screen. I also chose to keep everything one color. I chose to do this because the nature of this data leads to the natural comparison of types of people in the viewers mind, and I wanted to negate that if at all possible. This also still applies across types of groups as well. A white person can be any religion, and assigning color to any of these categories could potentially accidentally imply a connection or lack thereof of two entirely distinct groupings of data.

Control layout #1 (by group):
	
	I chose this dataset to allow people to see the discrimination across groups we encounter every day. However, deciding how to organize this data could potentially get problematic, as displaying different types of discrimination on the same display would allow people to naturally compare the various types of discimination. The point of this was never to bring up the question of, "is this type of group [sexes, races, etc] better or worse off than others?", so I tried to keep it as much of an even playing field as possible. Through this control, people can only look at the matter of race on its own, or sex on its own, and then ask questions about that. Additionally, it does not allow the user to get the impression that members of a group only belong to that group. For example, a black person can also chose to not identify with a gender, and I wanted to prevent the mistaken idea of seperation between these groups as well. 

	Despite all of the effort to avoid letting viewers ask misguided questions, there are still plenty of questions that a viewer can ask. There is naturally the question of which group has the most cases of hate crimes within a group type, but there is also plenty of comparisons to be made about hate crimes across group types. For example, I was able to see the scope of how much racial tension there is, and how evident that is in the number of hate crimes dictated by race, as opposed to gender or other categories.

Control layout #2 (by record type):
	
	I chose this second form of data control so that the user could understand the differences in how the hate crimes against a certain group tends to proceed. Allowing someone to see that a certain group has more victims than others can tell a viewer a lot, especially if that group had a lower number of incidences or offenses. This would imply at least one event had a number of people affected by it- more than most. Furthermore, I wanted to highlight the difference between offenses and incidences, because it allows the viewer to see if the hate crimes that occured also impacted other groups. A group that had more offenses than incidences means that hate crimes targeted at that group also impacted other groups.

	Having this kind of data allows people to ask more complex questions about the data. Just allowing people to compare the number of offenses does not paint a very clear picture of how many were affected, and in what ways they were. This allows viewers to look across data by group, and then ask questions about that group's experiences. Was it a hate crime against multiple groups? Was it a large group of people targeted at once?
	There are plenty of questions to extract from these two dimensions of data.
